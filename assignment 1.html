    <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
    <p>Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American engineer, futurist, and inventor. 
        He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>

    <h3>Here's a timeline of Nikola Tesla</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Life:</strong> Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia (then part of the Austrian Empire), 
            into a Serbian Orthodox family. His father was a priest, and his mother had a talent for inventing household devices.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Tesla attended the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz and later studied at the Charles University 
            in Prague, though he did not complete his degree due to financial troubles.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Work with Edison:</strong> In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. and began working for Thomas Edison. They clashed 
            due to differing views on electricity—Tesla promoted alternating current (AC), while Edison backed direct current (DC).</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>AC Power Development:</strong> Tesla’s invention of the alternating current motor revolutionized the way electricity 
            was generated and distributed. His system of AC power was safer and more efficient for long-distance transmission than Edison’s DC system.</li><br>

        <li><strong>War of Currents:</strong> Tesla’s AC system was at the heart of the “War of Currents” with Edison’s DC system. Backed by industrialist 
            George Westinghouse, Tesla’s AC technology eventually became the standard in the U.S. and globally.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Tesla Coil:</strong> Tesla invented the Tesla coil, which is still used in radio technology today. It was also the foundation of 
            his efforts in wireless transmission of electricity and communication.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Inventions and Patents:</strong> Tesla held over 300 patents in his lifetime. His work contributed to the development of X-rays, 
            radio waves, induction motors, remote control, and neon lighting.</li><br>

        <li><strong>World's Fair:</strong> In 1893, Tesla’s AC system was showcased at the Chicago World’s Fair, solidifying its dominance. Tesla also 
            demonstrated wireless lighting during this event.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Later Life Struggles:</strong> Despite his contributions, Tesla was not a great businessman. He fell into financial hardship in 
            his later years, as some of his more ambitious ideas, such as wireless electricity transmission, did not receive funding.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Death and Legacy:</strong> Tesla died alone on January 7, 1943, in New York City. Though he died in poverty, his contributions to 
            modern electricity and technology have made him one of the most celebrated inventors in history.</li><br>
